# Another-Raycaster

Three subsequent raycaster implementations based on the 3DSage Raycaster video series. See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYRrGTC7GtA, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC1RaETIx3Y and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0Bm4IA-Ii8)

The series is loosely progressive - each implementation builds upon the previous one, but there's some serious refactoring between part 1 and 2 that isn't elaborated on in the videos. To best understand the code I advise to start at the first part, and work your way through the series. You can use a difference analysis tool (like WinMerge) to identify the changes and additions for each implementation in comparison with the previous one. And it helps of course if you check out the 3DSage videos while looking through the code.

In each cpp file I added a short description where I summarize what that particular part is about. I also included the notes I kept while watching the videos and implementing them.

There are a few dependencies:

all implementations are built upon the olcPixelGameEngine.h header file by JavidX9 - see: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine
for some of the implementations you need some sprite or file. I uploaded my own sprites and textures to this repo, but you can use your own if you want. Adapt the file name in the code to match your needs.

NOTE: this code may very well contain bugs. If you have ideas or contributions on how to solve these, you are more than welcome :)

Have fun with it!
